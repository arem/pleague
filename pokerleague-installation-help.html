						  <p><b>PokerMax Poker League</b> was wrtitten by <b>Steve
							 Dawson</b> of <a href="http://www.stevedawson.com"
							 target="new">www.stevedawson.com</a> - always check here for the latest version
							 of any of my scripts.</p><br />
						  <h1><img src="pokeradmin/images/ace-spades.gif" width="27"
							 height="27" />&nbsp;&nbsp;PokerMax Poker League Overview</h1>
						  <p align="justify">Before we delve right in and install the
							 script, I thought I would let you read a bit about the planning of the script
							 and what it does. Obviously PokerMax Poker League, is a simple solution to get
							 the league table of tournaments and leaderboard on your website or just to keep
							 track of the results for a pub team online.</p>
						  <p align="justify">This software will allow you to run a
							 poker league on your website, pub place of business etc. It can only run one
							 poker league at a time. Each poker league can be made up of an unlimited number
							 of tournaments which cover the league. You can also create your poker league
							 players a profile with a little bit about themselves, so when there name appear
							 on the poker tournament leaderboard and poker tournament result pages, visitors
							 to your website can view a short profile about them.</p>
						  <p align="justify">Please be aware this is not a PHP Poker
							 script which will allow any user to register, create an account and then
							 register for tournaments, PokerMax Poker League will need an poker tournament
							 or admin area administrator to add players, their profiles, cerate the
							 tournaments for the league and add/update any scores the poker players have
							 accumulated over the poker tournament duration.</p>
						  <ul>
							 <li>Create a Poker League and add the league
								information</li>
							 <li>The Poker League can have an unlimited number or
								tournaments and venues associated with the poker league.</li>
							 <li>Unlimited poker players can be added to PokerMax
								Poker League script, you only need to add the poker players information once,
								then you can assign which ever poker players to the poker tournaments they have
								entered for. This saves valuable time entering the poker players names and
								nicames into every tournament they enter. This also allows any new players to
								join anytime in the duration of the poker league and of course, they are not
								required to enter into every poker tournament.</li>
						  </ul>
						  <h1><img src="pokeradmin/images/ace-spades.gif" width="27"
							 height="27" />&nbsp;&nbsp;System Requirements</h1>
						  <p>To install PokerMax Poker League on your web server,
							 first you need to make sure that your web host / server meet a few requirements
							 and they are:</p>
						  <ul>
							 <li>PHP Enabled Webserver</li>
							 <li>MySQL database facilities</li>
							 <li>PHPMyAdmin or Database Manager</li>
							 <li>And a little bit of common sense!</li>
						  </ul>
						  <h1><img src="pokeradmin/images/ace-spades.gif" width="27"
							 height="27" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing PokerMax Poker League</h1>
						  <p align="justify">Right, after reading thru the above
							 information I guess you are reading to install, follow the steps below to have
							 a safe install. If you have any problems, the only thing it could be is that
							 you have not edited the config file correctly, this file is located at
							 includes/config.php Always use a text editor to open or edit this file.</p>
						  <ol>
							 <li>Unpack all the files, keeping the directory structure
								in place from the zip file.</li>
							 <li>Open the includes/config.php file in a text editor
								and enter the name of your database, database username and database
								password.</li>
							 <li>Upload all of the files to your web server.</li>
							 <li>Open up your browser and point it to
								<a href="install/">http://yourdomain/install/</a> and follow the on screen
								instructions to start the installation process.</li>
							 <li>5. Then the file <b>pokerleague_.php</b> can be added
								to your website to display the poker tournament leaderboard, poker player
								information and the results of each of the tournaments in the poker
								league.</li>
						  </ol>
						  <p align="justify">Installing PokerMax Pro should only take
							 a matter of minutes by using our installer. After installation has been
							 completed successfully remember to delete the install/ directory and contents
							 which is located in the admin folder. This directory is a serious security risk
							 and should not be left on the web server after installation is complete.</p>
						  <p align="justify">If you want to use the back-up feature
							 which is built in to PokerMax Poker League, you will need to chmod the
							 admin/backup folder to 777, to allow the back-ups to be created and stored.
							 Remember to password protect this directory !</p>
						  <h1><img src="pokeradmin/images/ace-spades.gif" width="27"
							 height="27" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding PokerMax Poker League to your Website</h1>
						  <p align="justify">PokerMax Poker League can be used as is,
							 straight from the box, so to speak, but to create the same look and feel as
							 your website, you can will need to create a template design page, which is
							 based on your website design. You can then enter the following line of code
							 into your webpage template and all league tables, player profiles, league
							 information will be able to view in your own design. It is that simple!</p>
						  <p>Add the following line to your web template where you
							 want the poker leaderboard tables etc. to appear:</p>
						  <p align="center"><font color="#FF0000">&lt;?php include
							 (&quot;pokerleague_.php&quot;); ?&gt;</font></p>
						  <p align="justify">The main file you will be working with
							 is called pokerleague_.php and this is the file that you will be including in
							 your web design template page. You can call the page directly in the browser
							 and use this in the default design, but it would look better in your own
							 website design theme and style, so it's worth taking the time to create the
							 template. </p>
						  <p>Hope you make use of the script and if you need help,
							 just ask!<br /><br /><b>Steve Dawson</b></p>
